Automatic Displacement Mapping (Fabric Conformation)
------------------------------------------------------
This is the "fabric bending" core of the system. The classic professional
technique (used in Photoshop clothing mockups) is:

  1. Take the grayscale luminance of the *base garment photo* in the print
     area -- folds and wrinkles show up as local light/dark variation.
  2. Treat that luminance as a height/bump map.
  3. Warp the flat design so it "sits" on that height map: pixels near a
     raised fold shift one way, pixels in a crease shift the other way,
     proportional to the local slope (gradient) of the height map.

We implement this with OpenCV `remap`, which is fast, vectorized, and scales
to high-resolution assets. The displacement map itself is computed ONCE per
base product photo (at admin upload time) and cached -- see models.py -- so
it costs nothing at request time.
